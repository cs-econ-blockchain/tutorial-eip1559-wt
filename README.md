**Project Summary**: 

In this article, we provide a tutorial for replicating the waiting time results in the paper entitled [“Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Time, and Consensus Security”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05574). As a data descriptor, we introduce two reliable data sources related to the empirical analysis of waiting time in the transaction fee mechanism: mempool data and blockchain transaction-level data, and describe the workflow to integrate these two data sources for further analysis. Subsequently, we demonstrate the step-by-step instructions for the data importing process and create a series of visualizations to replicate, validate, and extend the results in the original paper that advances the understanding of how the EIP-1559 can affect waiting time in the transaction fee mechanism on Ethereum .
